# DGM to Osiris Architecture Mapping

This document outlines a preliminary component-level mapping from the theoretical Gödel Machine (DGM) architecture to the practical roles and systems within the Osiris platform. This mapping is intended to guide the integration of DGM-inspired research subsystems.

## Component-Level Mapping

*This section will contain the draft mapping between DGM components and Osiris functionalities.*
